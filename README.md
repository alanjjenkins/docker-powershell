# Docker Powershell

This is a Docker image for a Arch Linux based Powershell container. The reason this has been created is that the current Microsoft official powershell image has a broken WSMan client and it is also broken under Mac OS (see: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/11216 ).

A built version of the image can be found at: https://hub.docker.com/r/alanjjenkins/powershell
